# GravitySketch

This fork exists to blacklist various apiserver_* and other metrics, it should
follow upstream in most other ways and making changes here should be avoided
whenever possible. Patching a chart is painful, so forking is simpler (and using
a locally vendored copy with a file:// repository is also painful, thus here we
are).

## How to make changes

Create a new branch from the desired point in time with the name
`gravitysketch/<tag-branch-or-sha-name>` (e.g. if branching changing the
`prometheus-22.6.6` tag create a branch called
`gravitysketch/prometheus-22.6.6`), and make changes there to simplify
syncing/rebasing.

## How to create a release

A release consists of our packaged charts (i.e. `*.tgz` files) and an
`index.yaml` all generated by `gravitysketch-scripts/prepare-release.sh`. The
script should pick up the existing copy of the `index.yaml` and merge it rather
than overwriting so that we can have multiple versions in flight at once. Bump
the chart version, create the relevant artifacts, and upload them to the git
repo to be accessed via raw.github.com.
